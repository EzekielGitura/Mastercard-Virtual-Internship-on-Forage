## Overview

This repository showcases the work completed during a *Virtual Work Experience: Cybersecurity Job Simulation* with *Mastercard* and *Forage* in *May 2024*. The focus was on *Phishing Defense*, where I designed and executed phishing email simulations, analyzed results, and provided recommendations to improve organizational security awareness.

---

### *Key Areas of Focus:*

1. *Phishing Email Simulation Design*
   - Developed and executed a realistic phishing email simulation targeting an organization's employees to evaluate their cybersecurity awareness and response to phishing attacks.

2. *Interpretation of Phishing Simulation Results*
   - Analyzed and interpreted simulation data to identify patterns of vulnerability and risk exposure.
   - Provided detailed reports to help inform security awareness training and corrective actions.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- *Cybersecurity Awareness*: Evaluated and improved the organization's preparedness against phishing threats.
- *Phishing Email Design and Execution*: Created phishing emails with varied levels of sophistication to test employee vigilance.
- *Data Analysis and Interpretation*: Extracted meaningful insights from simulation results to guide the creation of more effective defenses.
- *Threat Detection and Mitigation*: Identified potential security risks based on the simulation and proposed strategies for mitigation.
- *Security Awareness Training*: Recommended tailored training modules to improve cybersecurity awareness across the organization.

## Project Walkthrough

### 1. *Phishing Email Simulation Design*
   - Developed phishing emails designed to simulate real-world attack vectors such as credential harvesting, malicious links, and attachment-based attacks.
   - Customized emails to target different departments based on the specific phishing tactics relevant to their roles.

### 2. *Execution and Monitoring*
   - Executed the phishing simulation over a period of time and monitored employee engagement with the simulated phishing emails.
   - Tracked who opened the emails, clicked links, or interacted with malicious content, providing real-time data for analysis.

### 3. *Result Interpretation*
   - Analyzed the collected data to identify employees or departments most vulnerable to phishing attacks.
   - Created reports with insights on potential risk areas, and highlighted any trends in employee behavior.

### 4. *Recommendations and Training*
   - Based on the results, provided recommendations on how to reduce the organization's susceptibility to phishing.
   - Proposed a tailored security awareness training program to educate employees on phishing tactics and how to recognize and avoid them.
